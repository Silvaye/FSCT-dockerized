# FSCT Dockerized + Local HTTP GUI

This is Silvaye's local, unoptomized version of FSCT made to run with an easy web GUI.

FSCT-Dockerized is comprised of a Dockerfile containing instructions for Docker on building the container, in addition to FSCT, a ML-based point cloud analysis tool, and a simple HTTP HTML/CSS/JS based front-end.

FSCT-Dockerized is deployed seperately, on Github's Container Registry Service.
